# bfdialog-lang README

BFDialog is a dialog scripting syntax that has high customizability and simple mechanics. This package adds syntax highlighting (with more to come) to VS Code for BFDialog lang. Download this as a vsix package [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mkk9pLZybn1LTJkLIZsyz7TumMKD2hbz/view?usp=sharing).

## Features

Works on files with extension `.bfdlg`

Highlights all closures, strings, numbers, and single-term calls. Also highlights default commands: `if`, `else`, `echo`, `reduce`

## Requirements

The bfo/dialog-textbox C# library

## Known Issues

Syntax highlighting happens outside of closures when it shouldn't. I don't know how to fix this, and I probably won't bother to, help appreciated.

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1

The very first release. Basic syntax highlighting.
